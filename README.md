## Project Spyn

  A company is looking for a autonomous vehicle in order to transport elderly and/or disabled people where they need to go. Our task is to use Lego Mindstorm to build a prototype vehicle that can move, turn, and transport and use MATLAB in order to create an algorithm that allows the vehicle to navigate a maze and react appropriately using touch, ultrasonic, and color sensors.
